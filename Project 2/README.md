The app allows for someone to check whether a person has liked tweets involving pictures with adult content 
I call it the cheater test app

As a spouse I want to check whether my spouse has been viewing adult twitter content 
As a parent I want to check if my child has liked adult content (because twitter doesnt have parental controls yet)

I used tweepy for the twitter api backend which made debugging a whole lot easier

I used google cloud visions analyzer to check whether an image as adult content or not

Then I used tkinter to create the gui
